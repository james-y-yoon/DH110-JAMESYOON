# Improving User Experience on UltimateGuitar.com Tabs

James Yoon

Digital Humanities 110: *User Experience and Design* (Spring '22)

### Description

When first learning guitar, many learners gravitate toward learning the chord progressions for their favorite songs, whether they be from rock, country, pop, or other genres. By practicing the finger placement associated with each chord and basic strumming, amateur guitar players can start to play a wide range of songs, which can boost their confidence and motivate them to keep practicing. 

Amateur and experienced guitar players have different needs when it comes to chord progressions. New players may need more detailed instructions and the ability to transpose chords with a capo so that complicated chords (like the six-string F chord or the B chord) can be played like simpler, beginner-friendly chords (like C or E). On the other hand, experienced guitar players may want the original song's chords to practice barre chords or more advanced strumming techniques.

This project will look at [UltimateGuitar.com](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) to improve its user experience for guitar players of all skill levels. UltimateGuitar.com provides tabs (chords) for 1,100,000 songs, and many tabs are crowd-sourced and rated for accuracy by fellow players.

For this heuristics assignment, I will compare UltimateGuitar.com's UX with [Chordify](https://chordify.net/en), a similar service that creates guitar tabs from YouTube videos. Both services have free and paid versions â€” this heuristic analysis will only analyze the free versions.

### 10 Usability Heuristics

To evaluate the user experience of each site, I will use [Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).

| Heuristic      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status      | Websites and apps should tell users the "status" of the system. This can include whether a page is loading, whether there is an error, or whether the device is connected to the Internet. There needs to be a way that they can monitor this **easily** without having to sift through the website.       |
| 2. Match between system and real world    |  To make a design intuitive, logos and symbols used in the website/app need to correspond with what users already see in the real world. One should minimize as much interface-specific jargon as possible so that users can infer which controls or designs lead to what actions or subpages.    |
| 3. User control and freedom    | Interfaces need to have a way for users to exit (i.e. back to the homepage). Users don't want to be pigeonholed into a specific process; they need the flexibility to stop what they're doing and do something else without having to force quit the app.       |
| 4. Consistency and standards    | Not only should there be a match between your interface and the *real world* (#2), but you should also keep other apps and standardized designs in mind as well. Like #2, one should use a limited amount of jargon and make the interface similar in function to similar apps that users may have used in the past.       |
| 5. Error prevention    | *We all make mistakes!* As a UX designer, it's important to expect these errors and to prevent them from occurring using safe-guards (e.g. "Invalid output!") or confirmation messages.       |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall   | We can only store a limited amount of information in our brains at once. Rather than forcing users to remember certain functions from a long tutorial, it's important to make the design as intuitive as possible so that they don't have to navigate convoluted pathways to get to where they need to be or remember what a specific button does.       |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use    | There should be some level of customization! Expert and beginner users will likely have different needs, so by tailoring too much to one population, you may miss out on the other. One should make their interface beginner-friendly while providing shortcuts for more experienced users.        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design    | Design should be focused on what's important. Superfluous content may detract from what's important! Clutter or decoration may unnecessarily increase a user's cognitive load.        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors    | Users should know when they have encountered an error and what steps to take afterward. A 404 error may mean a lot to an IT specialist, but a novice user may not understand what it means. One should put the error message into plain terms and guide them through troubleshooting.        |
| 10. Help and documentation    | Similar to #9, if errors occur, there should be resources to help users troubleshoot. This documentation should be accessible and easy to search, and it should be readable by users not familiar with IT.        |

I'll rank each site by each of the ten usability heuristics, in addiiton to a severity score relating to how urgently this heuristic should be fixed. The severity score is in the range \[1,3\], with 1 being not severe and 3 being the most severe.

### UltimateGuitar.com

[UltimateGuitar.com](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) hosts 1,100,000 guitar tabs, as well as forums, guided guitar courses, and video hosting for users to share their own guitar recordings. Although most of the tabs are crowd-sourced, each tab is associated with a rating out of five stars that players can use to rate how well the tab corresponds to the original song's progression. 

From my impressions, UltimateGuitar strives to be a one-stop center for all guitar enthusiasts: by hosting tabs, courses, and a forum, guitar players can build community while learning their favorite songs. In addition, its crowd-sourcing creates a large library of tabs, and the rating system allows more accurate chords to be indicated over lower-quality tabs. However, I do wonder if its rather cluttered design may be a result of its wide range of purposes. By focusing on too many things, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what's important.
