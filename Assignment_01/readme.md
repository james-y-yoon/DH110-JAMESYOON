### Description

When first learning guitar, many learners gravitate toward learning the chord progressions for their favorite songs, whether they be from rock, country, pop, or other genres. By practicing the finger placement associated with each chord and basic strumming, amateur guitar players can start to play a wide range of songs, which can boost their confidence and motivate them to keep practicing. 

Amateur and experienced guitar players have different needs when it comes to chord progressions. New players may need more detailed instructions and the ability to transpose chords with a capo so that complicated chords (like the six-string F chord or the B chord) can be played like simpler, beginner-friendly chords (like C or E). On the other hand, experienced guitar players may want the original song's chords to practice barre chords or more advanced strumming techniques.

This project will look at [UltimateGuitar.com](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) to improve its user experience for guitar players of all skill levels. UltimateGuitar.com provides tabs (chords) for 1,100,000 songs, and many tabs are crowd-sourced and rated for accuracy by fellow players.

For this heuristics assignment, I will compare UltimateGuitar.com's UX with [Chordify](https://chordify.net/en), a similar service that creates guitar tabs from YouTube videos. Both services have free and paid versions â€” this heuristic analysis will only analyze the free versions.
