# What is a High-Fidelity Prototype?

A high-fidelity prototype takes the static layouts and interfaces from the low-fidelity prototype into an interactive prototype that one can interact with. My project involved redesigning Ultimate-Guitar.com so that it was more user-friendly and more accessible for both beginner and advanced guitar players, particularly for my target audience of middle-aged male guitar learners. Following the low-fidelity prototype and interface design process, I added interactivity on Figma and went through multiple interations of my prototype after conducting 4 usability tests and a cognitive walkthrough.

# Prototype Tasks

Based on my contextual inquiry and personas/usage scenarios, my prototype supports the following tasks:

- Navigating guitar tabs; adding comments; and reading the tab's strumming patterns, key and chord fingerings (specifically, Bjork's Pagan Poetry - although this song is merely a model for the overall interactivity)
- Navigating the courses on Ultimate-Guitar and clicking on videos/adding comments
- Searching through and liking/commenting on community-uploaded videos
- Searching through the Ultimate-Guitar forums and replying to a forum thread
- Adding a tab (not a main task as indicated in the Usability Testing or the personas; added for completeness)
