## Research Goal and Requirements

### Main Activity
> I want Ultimate-Guitar to be a website that both beginner and advanced guitar players can use to find guitar tabs and to learn from the community (videos, forums, courses). 

### Basic Need/Goal
> I envision Ultimate-Guitar to be fulfilling aesthetic needs within Maslow's hierarchy. Furthermore, learning guitar on your own or with a teacher can also fulfill Esteem needs, as the work that they put into it may boost their self-confidence.

### Traditional Solutions & Limitations
There are a couple of solutions currently available, each with their own limitations.

#### \[Current\] Ultimate Guitar
- The current iteration of Ultimate-Guitar is crowded and isn't beginner friendly, but fulfills many of the goals that I set out to target (community, tabs, courses). This project seeks to improve Ultimate-Guitar's UX.

#### YouTube/Video Hosting
- YouTube can also be a way to learn guitar, but unlike a traditional course, there is no sense of self-assessment nor progression. It can be easy to find differing opinions on certain guitar techniques or the order in which you learn them. In addition, not every video might have tabs or sheet music for those who want to learn a song on their own.

#### Traditional Guitar Lessons
- These may not be affordable nor accessible to everyone, and there's less flexibility in regards to what songs you get to play (e.g. you may not be able to learn your favorite genre of music, or your teacher may be classically trained when you'd prefer a less formal teaching style.



## Target Users

The users I want to target are older young adults to middle-aged guitar players with a wide range of guitar playing expertise and genre preferences. If I were to narrow my target user even more, I'd want to focus on beginner guitar players or instrumentalists (particularly pianists and ukelele players, since Ultimate-Guitar also contains tabs for those instruments) who briefly tried guitar in the past, since it appears that Ultimate-Guitar in its current iteration is more conducive to advanced players.

These users would typically use this website to prepare for upcoming performances or to keep their mind busy. They may use this website either alone (e.g. practicing guitar at home) or in groups (an ensemble, a guitar class, etc...).

To complete this activity, they'd have to get a guitar by buying or renting one; create a group ensemble (if they are interested); learn guitar chord fingerings through the website or another resource; learn basic music theory (tempo, key signature, how to play in groups, how to watch a conductor, measures, chords); and practice basic strumming on the guitar.


## Qualitative Research Methodology
I chose to research through two methods: overt non-participant observation and an interview/contextual inquiry. I conducted the interview first, followed by the observation to supplement my findings.

I chose to observe a small group ensemble rehearsal on Saturday, April 16th at 5 PM PDT. The rehearsal took place in UCLA's Schoenberg Music Building, and the ensemble was going to be the pit for an upcoming play. The ensemble consisted of a bass player, a pianist, a percussionist, a wind player, and a trombonist, along with the conductor. I interviewed the pianist (21M) who revealed they had played drums and guitar before for thirty minutes, followed by observing how the musicians interacted with their sheet music (notations) and how they played in groups for thirty minutes. I recorded the interview and the activities through voice recording, and my observations were compiled in field notes on my tablet.
