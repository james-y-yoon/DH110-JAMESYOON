## What is Usability Testing (UT)?

Usability testing uses actual users (ideally from the target demographic group) to collect data on an interface's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.

| Parameter      | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Effectiveness      | Whether users are able to perform a specified task and achieve a goal.       |
| Efficiency   | How quickly the user can complete this task.        |
| Satisfaction   | How the user feels after completing this task; the attitudes associated with the task.        |

In addition to the three parameters above, UT can also provide insight into **learnability** (how easy it is for new users to learn tasks), **memorability** (whether users can perform these tasks after a break), and **usefulness** (a combination of usability and utility - whether it provides information these users would need or are interested in). By using UT, we can create user centered design by iterating the design process depending on the UT results. 

It is often useful to couple heuristic analysis by experts with UT. Heuristic analysis can find more severe errors and can prime the issues you want to focus on in following UT runs, while UT uncovers more global usability problems and predicts end-user problems better than heuristic analysis. These two methods have little overlap, so it's good to use both when identifying problems with interfaces.

For my heuristic analysis of Ultimate-Guitar, I found that there were quite a few problems with **consistency** (namely what "Shots" in the main menu refers to), **flexibility** (that it's too tailored to advanced users and guitar players), and **aesthetics** (too much information on the homepage). 

To accomodate this, I designed four tasks for UT: navigating the Courses page (ensures that beginners can still access appropriate material), transposing a guitar tab (ensures that users can access important guitar tab changes), watching and interacting with Shots (addresses consistency in navigation), and entering and interacting with recent forum threads (partly aesthetics and flexibility - can a user navigate to forums without being distracted by the other modules)?

This UT will serve as a pilot. By analyzing how well this test goes, we can improve these UT tasks for an official round later this quarter.
